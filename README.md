# Project-3-CoalReclaimerMaintenance
Project 3 - Coal Reclaimer machine maintenance assessment for the incoming month

## Background:
The coal industry is very large with many imports and exports into countries. Part of this project assessment is to determine if their machine that runs round the clock will require maintenance in the upcoming month.

## Problem Statement:
As these coal reclaimers runs round the clock, any downtime can lead to lost in revenue in the thousands or millions of dollars. That is why it is important to identify when maintenance is required. 

### CriterionL:
The reclaimer machine requires maintenance when within the previous month there was at least a one 8-hour period of average idle capacity that was over 10%

The task was then to figure out which of the 5 machines (present in the data) has exceeded this level. A report may be created to notify and present the findings to stakeholders about the recommendations for the following month.
